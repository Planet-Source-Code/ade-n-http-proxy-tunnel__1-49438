ade http tunnel v. 1.1 (2003-10-25)

a http proxy tunneling program. here's a top-down sketch of what it does.<br>

the arrows indicate the way the initial connection goes. data goes both ways
later on, of course.
<br><br>
So... what you need:<br>
1. a client program (machine A) requiring a <i>single outgoing TCP connection</i> to a remote host (machine C).<br>
2. a http proxy blocking the client to do the above.<br>
3. a machine (C) with a unblocked connection to the net, with the httptunnel server running.<br>
<br>
If you understand this clearly, you should get this software running.<br>
However, it is worth noticing that this software is highly experimental and not very good. But it does work.. mostly :)<br>
<br>
I learned alot programming this program (that's why I made it), I hope you will too.<br>
You're on your own now...<br>
